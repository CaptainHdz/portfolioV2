          <p class="lead">Hi, my name is Mauricio Hernandez. I was born in Houston, Texas to a humble immigrant family and have spent my entire life in the city. Some of my favorite things to do on my free time are reading, anything music, sports, and spending time with family. My favorite sports are long-distance running, boxing, and basketball. I also enjoy the process of creating. From music, to art, to coding. It is for this reason I believe I have a fondness for coding. The sum of every detail makes programming a long, but rewarding process. Every detail adds up.
